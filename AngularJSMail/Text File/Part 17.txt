To add custom data to a state use data property.
 data: {
            customData1: "Home State Custom Data 1",
            customData2: "Home State Custom Data 2"
        }

The custom data is now available in all the controllers. 
To access state custom data from it's controller (i.e to access home state data from home controller) use $state.current.data.customPropertyName. 
To access state custom data from a different controller (i.e to access courses state data from home controller) use $state.get("statename").data.customPropertyName.

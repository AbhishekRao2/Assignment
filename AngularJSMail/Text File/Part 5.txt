
part5:- Sorting data N Search filter in AngularJS

To sort the data in Angular
1. Use orderBy filter
    {{ orderBy_expression | orderBy : expression : reverse}}
    Example : ng-repeat="employee in employees | orderBy:'salary':false"
2. To sort in ascending order, set reverse to false
3. To sort in descending order, set reverse to true
4. You can also use + and - to sort in ascending and descending order respectively
     Example : ng-repeat="employee in employees | orderBy:'+salary'"



search only one specific column:-
<input type="text" ng-model="searchText.city" placeholder="Search employees" />


Part13:- Difference between $scope and $rootScope  N cancel route change 

1) $rootScope is available globally (for all controllers), whereas $scope is only available to the controller that has created it and it's children. 



how to cancel route change in Angular:-
This is extremely useful if you want to warn a user when they are navigating away from a page with unsaved changes. 


.controller("studentsController", function ($http, $route, $scope) {
    var vm = this;

    $scope.$on("$routeChangeStart", function (event, next, current) {
        if (!confirm("Are you sure you want to navigate away from this page")) {
            event.preventDefault();
        }
    });

    vm.reloadData = function () {
        $route.reload();
    }

    $http.get("StudentService.asmx/GetAllStudents")
                .then(function (response) {
                    vm.students = response.data;
                })

})


When route navigation occurs in an Angular application, the following events are triggered
1. $locationChangeStart
2. $routeChangeStart
3. $locationChangeSuccess
4. $routeChangeSuccess


$locationChangeStart: this uses the $location provider and broadcast whenever the URL change, location refers more to a Path of a specific URL it's more like plain javascript, you can change to any path in your application and it doesn't matter if defined on your app as route or state.

$routeChangeStart: this uses the $route provider, and it's the same broadcast when the route change (default Angular router used with ngRoute) this is used to do a link between controllers and views.

$log service:-
log the events.
eg:-$log.debug("RouteChangeStart Event");

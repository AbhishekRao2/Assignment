How?
=============================================================

part1:- My first AngularJS page

To get started with angular
1. Add a reference to the angular script
	https://angularjs.org/

2. Include ng-app attribute 

what is Directives:-
AngularJS directives are used to extend HTML. These are special attributes starting with ng- prefix. 
AngularJS has a set of built-in directives which offers functionality to your applications.
AngularJS also lets you define your own directives.
eg:- ng-app, ng-repeat, ng-src etc

At a high level, directives are markers on a DOM element (such as an attribute, element name, CSS class) that tell AngularJS's HTML compiler ($compile) to attach a specified behavior to that DOM element (e.g. via event listeners), or even to transform the DOM element and its children.


What is ng-app 
In angular, ng-app is called a directive. 
The ng prefix in the directive stands for angular. 
The ng-app directive is a starting point of AngularJS Application.  
Angular framework will first check for ng-app directive in an HTML page after the entire page is loaded. If ng-app directive is found, angular bootstraps itself and starts to manage the section of the page that has the ng-app directive. 


Binding Expressions:-
Double curly braces are called binding expressions in angular.


Example:-

{{ 1 == 1 }} - Evaluates to true
{{ { name: 'David', age : '30' }.name }} - Returns the name property value
{{ ['Mark', 'David', 'Sara'][2] }} - Returns the 2nd element from the array

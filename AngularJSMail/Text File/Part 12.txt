art12:- Benefits of controller as syntax N route reload

Angular nested scopes and controller as syntax :-
the CONTROLLER AS syntax can make our code more readable as opposed to using $scope when working with nested scopes.


the differences
1. CONTROLLER AS syntax is new and is officially released in 1.2.0. $scope is the old technique and is available since the initial version of angular is released.

2. You can use either one of thes techniques. Both have their own uses. For example, CONTROLLER AS syntax makes your code more readable when working with nested scopes. 

3. If you want to use $scope it has to be injected into controller function, where as with CONTROLLER AS syntax there is no need for such injection, unless you need it for something else.





Angular route service reload() method:-
This method is useful when you want to reload just the current route instead of the entire app.

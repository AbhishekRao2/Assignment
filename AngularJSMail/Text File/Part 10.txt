Step 1 : Enable html5mode routing. To do this inject $locationProvider into config() function in script.js and call html5Mode() method passing true as the argument value. 
Step 2 : In index.html, remove # symbols from all the links. 
Step 3 : Include the following URL rewrite rule in web.config. This rewrite rule, rewrites all urls to index.html, except if the request is for a file, or a directory or a Web API request.
Step 4 : Set the base href to the location of your single page application. In the head section of index.html include the following line.
<base href="/" />



At the moment the problem is that, if you try to navigate to a route that is not configured, you will see only the layout page without any partial template injected into it.

How to configure the default route in Angular :
.otherwise({
    redirectTo: "/home"
})




caseInsensitiveMatch : 
The routes that are configured using config function are case sensitive by default.
To make the route case-insensitive set caseInsensitiveMatch property to true as shown below.
 $routeProvider
    .when("/students", {
                        templateUrl: "Templates/students.html",
                        controller: "studentsController",
                        caseInsensitiveMatch: true
                    })


To make all routes case-insensitive set caseInsensitiveMatch property on $routeProvider.
$routeProvider.caseInsensitiveMatch = true;




Inline Template:-
 $routeProvider
    .when("/home", {
        template: "<h1>Inline Template in action</h1>",
        controller: "homeController",
        controllerAs: "homeCtrl"
    })

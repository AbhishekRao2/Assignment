Reason for the 404 error
As soon as the DOM is parsed, an attempt is made is to fetch the image from the server. At this point, AngularJS binding expression that is specified with the src attribute is not evaluated. Hence 404 (not found) error.

Fix:-
ng-src attribute ensures that a request is issued only after AngularJS has evaluated the binding expression 





ng-model directive:-
ng-model directive automatically takes the form values and updates the model. 
The binding expression does the opposite, i.e whenever the model changes the view is automatically updated. 


ng-model directive can be used with the following 3 html elements
input 
select
textarea




ng-repeat:-
ng-repeat is similar to foreach loop in C#.
